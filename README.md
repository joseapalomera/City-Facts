# City-Facts
This project serves as a RESTful application that uses API's from OpenWeather and Yelp. The purpose of this project was to extract data from OpenWeather, and another website through the use of their public API's. In addition to this, we had to accept a location input from the user and present to them the weather, and another interesting fact about the location.
